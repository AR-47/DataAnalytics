## Project List  

### 1. [CovidData-Analysis-SQL](./DataAnalysis)  
- **Description**: This project analyzes COVID-19 data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Aggregated global data to calculate key metrics like infection rates, recovery trends, and death rates.  
  - Used SQL queries for filtering, grouping, and deriving insights based on country and timeline.  
  - Showcased visualizations created using Power BI (if applicable).  
- **Skills Demonstrated**:  
  - Data aggregation and transformations.  
  - Statistical calculations.  
  - Query optimization for large datasets.  

### 2. [Housing Data Cleaning](./DataCleaning)  
- **Description**: This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a real estate dataset containing housing project data.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Standardized and formatted dates for consistency.
